# Face Gender Classification with MobileNetV3-Small + SE Attention

This project aims to build a lightweight and accurate deep learning model for gender classification from facial images using the MobileNetV3-Small architecture enhanced with Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention. The model is trained and evaluated on a dataset organized into gender-based subfolders ("male" and "female").

##  Features

* âœ… MobileNetV3-Small backbone (pretrained on ImageNet)
* âœ… SE Attention module for adaptive feature selection
* âœ… Grad-CAM visualization support
* âœ… Confusion matrix + classification report
* âœ… Lightweight and fast training

### Validation Classification Report:

```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

      female       0.89      0.68      0.77        79
        male       0.93      0.98      0.95       343

    accuracy                           0.92       422
   macro avg       0.91      0.83      0.86       422
weighted avg       0.92      0.92      0.92       422

```

### Accuracy:

*  92% overall accuracy on validation set

### Confusion Matrix:
Visualized using seaborn to show true positives, false positives.

### Grad-CAM Visualization:
Grad-CAM heatmaps were used to visualize where the model focuses when predicting gender from a face. Results showed attention around eyes, nose, and jawline.

________________________________________

Train on your own dataset:

```bash
python train.py \
    --train_path /path/to/train \
    --val_path /path/to/val \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch_size 16 \
    --save_model pretrained.pth
```

---

##  Testing:

A separate test.py script is provided that:
â€¢	Accepts a test dataset path (same folder structure)
â€¢	Loads the pretrained model
Evaluate the model on new test data:

```bash
python test.py \
    --model_path pretrained.pth \
    --test_path /path/to/test
```

It will output:

* Accuracy
* Precision
* Recall
* F1-Score
* Confusion matrix
